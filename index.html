           <h3>Established Patients</h3>
           
        <p>I only see <strong>established patients</strong> (patients who have seen me in the past or currently seeing me) and <strong>new patients referred by an established patient.</strong></p>   
        <p>I have dropped my requirements for Covid vaccination but encourage you to maintain boosters and, in general, practice community-caring behavior:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Many of my patients are at high risk for severe disease outcomes from Covid and other acute diseases and/or have family members who are immune compromised, so I continue to take not being a vector for disease transmission seriously.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I will continue to space Â½ an hour between appointments to air out the treatment space and clean surfaces between clients. I will also continue to mask with an N95 during treatment.
        </p>
        <p>Patients may choose whether to continue masking.</p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Do not come into an appointment if you are acutely ill, still symptomatic from acute illness, or if you would have symptoms without over-the-counter or prescription medicines (cough, sore throat, sneezing, vomiting, loose stools, etc.) Also, do not come in if you have had recent contact with someone symptomatic of an acute illness.
            </strong>
        </p>

            
        <p>I do not charge for last-minute cancellations due to illness.</p>
        <p>If you are sick and/or want an herbal consultation via video chat, that is an option. Herbs can be shipped to your home via two-day mail or directly picked up at Northwestern Health Sciences Herbal Dispensary in Bloomington.
        </p>
        
        <p>If you need help with scheduling with the online system, email or text me with your name and desired appointment time.</p>

            <h3>New Patients</h3>
        <p>I am only seeing new patients who are referred to me via established clients.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a direct referral from one my established patients please visit this resource for <a href="./other_practitioners/index.html" target="_blank">other local acupuncture practitioners.</a></p>
        <p><strong>New patient appointment requests without a referral from an established patient will be disregarded.</strong></p>
