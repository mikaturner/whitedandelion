           <h3>Current and Established Patients</h3>
           
        <p>Hello friends! Thank you for your trust and support since 2012. I appreciate you! I remain committed to serving your needs.</p>
        
        <p>I have lifted the COVID vaccination requirements but encourage boosters and community-caring behavior. Many of my patients are at high risk, so I take disease transmission seriously.</p>

        <p>Starting August 1st, my morning appointments will have 15-minute intervals for ventilation and cleaning (9-10am, 10:15-11:15am, and 11:30am-12:30pm). This change allows me to bike commute again. Afternoon slots (2-3pm and 3:30-4:30pm) will still have 30-minute intervals. I will continue wearing an N95 mask during treatments. You may choose whether to mask based on your comfort level.</p>

        <p>Please do not come in if you are acutely ill, symptomatic, or have had recent contact with someone who is. There are no charges for last-minute cancellations due to illness.</p>

        <p>For those who are sick or prefer not to come in, herbal consultations via video chat are available, with herbs shipped to your home. If you need help scheduling, email or text me with your name and desired appointment time.</p>

        <p>Thanks!</p>

            <h3>New Patients</h3>
        <p>I am only accepting new patients referred by established clients.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a direct referral, please visit this resource for <a href="./other_practitioners/index.html" target="_blank">other local acupuncture practitioners.</a></p>
        <p><strong>New patient appointment requests without a referral from an established patient will be disregarded.</strong></p>
