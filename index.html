           <h3>Current and Established Patients</h3>
           
        <p>Hello friends! Thank you for your trust and support since 2012. I appreciate you! I remain committed to serving your needs.</p>
        
        <p>I have lifted the COVID vaccination requirements but encourage boosters and community-caring behavior. Many of my patients are at high risk, so I take disease transmission seriously.</p>

        <p>My morning appointments have 15-minute intervals between appointment times for ventilation and cleaning (9-10am, 10:15-11:15am, and 11:30am-12:30pm). Afternoon slots (2-3pm and 3:30-4:30pm) have 30-minute intervals in between appointment slots for ventilation and cleaning. I continue wearing an N95 mask during treatments. You may choose whether to mask based on your comfort level.</p>

        <p>Please do not come in if you are acutely ill, symptomatic, or have had recent contact with someone who is. If you have lingering symptoms such as a cough, even though otherwise feel recovered please wear a mask during treatment. There are no charges for last-minute cancellations due to illness.</p>

        <p>For those who are sick or prefer not to come in, herbal consultations via video chat are available, with herbs shipped to your home. If you need help scheduling, email or text me with your name and desired appointment time.</p>

        <p>Thanks!</p>

            <h3>New Patients</h3>
            <p>I am currently accepting new patients. After you request an appointment, you'll receive a confirmation email with a link to sign up for my patient portal. Please ensure you provide a valid email address to receive this email, and check your junk or spam folder if it doesnâ€™t arrive.</p>
            <p>Before your first visit, you are required to sign up for the patient portal and complete the new patient health history and consent to treatment forms. These must be submitted at least 24 hours prior to your appointment. Unfortunately, there will not be time to fill them out in the office, and I reserve the right to cancel appointments if these forms are not completed on time.</p>
            <p>Completing the forms in advance helps me understand your health history better and ensures a more efficient intake and treatment process.</p>
            <p> Please do not come in if you are acutely ill, symptomatic, or have had recent contact with someone who is. If you have lingering symptoms such as a cough, even though otherwise feel recovered please wear a mask during treatment. There are no charges for last-minute cancellations due to illness.</p>
